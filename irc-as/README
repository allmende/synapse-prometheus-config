Please see wiki/MatrixOps for how this is setup. The abridged version is:

IRC-AS -- UDP --> Statsd Server -- UDP --> Statsd-Prometheus Bridge <-- HTTP -- Prometheus
  1                    2                            3                              4

1 - The AS sends stats as UDP
2 - The Statsd server acts as a 'repeater' and forwards these stats to the
    bridge (this is statsd-config.js)
3 - The bridge maps statsd metrics to prometheus metrics and exposes a listener
    (this is statsd-prometheus-mappings.cfg)
4 - Prometheus hits the bridge to get latest stats.

If you're setting this up, this directory contains the correct config options.
